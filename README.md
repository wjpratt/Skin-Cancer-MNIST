# Skin-Cancer-MNIST
In this project we trained two deep neural networks intended for the task of skin-lesion classification. We used two different architectures with slightly different hyperparameters. We achieved 84% overall accuracy on HAM10000 using the ResNet model. We used optional means of data preprocessing including data augmentation, which enables our models to not overfit and various metrics to compare our models performances. These metrics included overall accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, proportion of incorrect classifications and consumed time. Results reveal that the ResNet50 CNN architecture provides the most accurate skin lesion classification, although it did consume much more computational time than the baseline CNN. For future revisions, continued experimentation with hyperparameters including activation functions, dropout, number of dense layers, and possibly creating an ensemble model should be considered to elevate accuracy.
